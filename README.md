# CineNet Project

The goal of this project is to show the relations between the nominees of the Oscare 2018. Using a network graph we want to illustrate the abundance of interaction between this sample of people.

## What will it look like ?

Our DataViz will be structured using the following key points :

<ul>
  <li> One Network Map : </li>
  <ul>
    <li>One node = One nominee 2018</li>
    <li>One link = One collaboration on one movie (period to be defined)</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Node length : proportional to the cumulate audience</li>
  <li> Node color : depend of the job of the nominee</li>
  <li> Nominee selection : using checkbox (grouped by category)</li>
</ul>
